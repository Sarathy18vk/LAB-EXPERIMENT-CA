This repository contains lab assignments and simulations for the **Computer Architecture** course. The work has been completed using the following tools:

- **GNUSim8085** – for 8085 microprocessor programming
- **EMU8086** – for 8086 microprocessor programming
- **Logisim** – for designing and simulating digital circuits

## Contents

- `8085/` – Assembly programs written and tested using GNUSim8085
- `8086/` – Assembly programs executed using EMU8086
- `Logisim/` – Digital logic circuits built using Logisim (e.g., adders, multiplexers, counters)

## Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| GNUSim8085   | 8085 Assembly programming and output |
| EMU8086      | 8086 Assembly simulation             |
| Logisim      | Digital logic design and simulation  |

## How to Run

### 8085 Programs
1. Open `GNUSim8085`.
2. Load the `.asm` file from the `8085/` folder.
3. Assemble and run the code.
4. Verify output in the register/memory window.

### 8086 Programs
1. Launch `EMU8086`.
2. Load the `.asm` file from the `8086/` folder.
3. Compile and run the simulation.
4. Observe the register and memory changes.

### Logisim Circuits
1. Open `Logisim`.
2. Load the `.circ` file from the `Logisim/` folder.
3. Simulate the circuit using input switches and observe output.
